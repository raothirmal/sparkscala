		Types :HIve CLI
		       Web Inerface
		       Thirft Server

3.Compiler : IT genearet the execution plan by using METASTORE
4. Metastore :MYSQL database

// Hive commands
 
 1.Create database ktr_udemy (or) create database if not exists ktr_udemy

 2.describe database ktr_udemy.

 3. Creat database if not exists ktr_udemy comment "this is a temp database"

 4. desc database extended ktr_udemy

 5. create database if not exists ktr_udemy_temp with dbproperties('creator'='trkonduri','date'='2019-10-06');



// create a table --> Hive doesnt through any error if tables exits if simply ignore the command

  create table if not exists table1(name string, location array<string>,income int) row format delimited fields terminated by',' collection items  terminated by ':' lines terminated by '\n' stored as textfile;

// Defalut Row termination Cntrl + A, Row Termination "\n" and stored as text file.


//hive metastore

set hive.matastore.warehouse.dir;

// Load the data

load data local inpath '/home/thackathon01/table1.txt' into table table1;

load data local inpath '/home/thackathon01/table1.txt' overwrite into table table1; //To load replace 



//Internal and external table;

1.Internal table controled access hive.
2.Both metadata and data contolled by hive
3.If we delete the table both data and metadata will be deleted.
3.We can acces these table trough hive only not by using other external applicatons.

//external

1. For external table data will be controlled by HDFS not Hive //Create external table
